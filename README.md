# Intergalactic Trade Network - Backend

This project is the backend for the Intergalactic Trade Network, built using *NestJS* and *MongoDB*. The API supports managing trades, cargo, and inventory through RESTful endpoints and real-time WebSocket features.

## Features

- *User Authentication*: JWT-based authentication.
- *Real-Time Updates*: WebSocket support for real-time notifications.
- *RESTful APIs*: CRUD operations for trades, cargo, and inventory.

## Design Decisions and Architecture

- *NestJS Framework*: Modular and scalable, allowing for easy integration and unit testing.
- *MongoDB*: A NoSQL database used for flexible schema management.
- *WebSocket*: Provides real-time updates for trades and inventory changes.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- *Node.js*: Ensure you have Node.js v14 or higher installed.
- *MongoDB*: Install MongoDB and run it locally or use a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/amitkojha05/myproject
   cd circlepe-backend
   

2. Install dependencies:
   
   npm install
   

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a .env file in the root directory:
   env
   
   DATABASE_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1/circlepe
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   PORT=3000
   

5. Start MongoDB (if not using cloud):
   
   mongod
   

6. Start the backend in development mode:
   
   npm run start:dev
   

## Running Tests

To run unit tests, execute:

npm run test

## Deployment

This project can be deployed on platforms like *Render* or *Heroku*.

1. *MongoDB*: Ensure you have a MongoDB Atlas connection string with the database whitelisted for IP access.
2. *Environment Variables*: Set up your .env file with variables like MONGO_URI and PORT.
3. *Render Deployment*:
    - Add your environment variables in Renderâ€™s dashboard.
    - Make sure your project is linked to your Git repository.
    - Follow the deployment logs for any errors.


## Known Limitations

- No detailed error handling for some edge cases.
- WebSocket connections are not yet fully authenticated.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced features for cargo and trade management.
- Enhance error handling and logging.
